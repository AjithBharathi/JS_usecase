// ðŸ”‘ What happens?

// ðŸ‘‰ immediateA is an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE), called with 0:

// immediateA(0);
// a = 0
// ðŸ‘‰ Inside immediateA, another IIFE immediateB is called with 1:

// immediateB(1);
// b = 1 (but it isnâ€™t used)
// ðŸ‘‰ Inside immediateB, it logs:

// console.log(a);
// Since a is available via closure:

// console.log(0);
// âœ… Final output

// 0
// âš¡ Summary

// immediateA runs with a = 0
// Inside immediateA, immediateB runs with b = 1
// immediateB logs a, which is 0
// Output: 0
// ðŸ’¡ Closure in action!
// immediateB has access to a because itâ€™s in the scope chain (enclosed by immediateA).

// If you'd like, I can show how to modify it to log both a and b, or how the closure works internally! ðŸš€
